##  Hardware Overview

- **Controller**: ESP32-C6 microcontroller (Wi-Fi/BLE enabled)
- **Inputs**: 3 sensors (e.g., IR or ultrasonic) to detect vehicles
- **Outputs**: 3 actuators (e.g., LEDs, buzzer, servo) for signaling or barrier control

##  Setup & Wiring

1. Connect the 3 sensors to ESP32-C6 GPIO pins (e.g., 15, 18, 19).
2. Connect outputs (LEDs, buzzer, servo) to output pins (e.g., 21, 22, 23).
3. Use common ground and 5 V / 3.3 V as appropriate.
